# My React Recipe App

A dynamic recipe app built with **React**, where users can explore meals, view details, and discover ingredients using TheMealDB API. This project demonstrates fetching data from APIs, interactive UI design, and responsive frontend development.

## Features

- Browse meals by category (e.g., beef, breakfast, etc.)
- Search for specific recipes
- View detailed recipe information including ingredients
- Clean and responsive UI powered by **HeroUI**
- Navigation between pages with **React Router**

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- HeroUI
- Fetch API
- React Router
- CSS/Tailwind for styling

## What I Learned

During this project, I improved my skills in:

- **Working with APIs**: Fetching, handling, and displaying dynamic data in React.
- **React framework**: Building component-based applications, managing state, and passing props effectively.
- **UI/UX design**: Incorporating **HeroUI** to create clean, responsive, and interactive interfaces.
- **Frontend best practices**: Organizing components, routing, and building reusable elements.
- Debugging and understanding asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

This project strengthened my understanding of combining **APIs with modern frontend frameworks** to create real-world applications.

## Problems I am solved

- Category cards doesnt show area I had to learn how to use APIs correctly
- Routing problems
- Integrating all these components into my pages correctly

## What I added

- Area and Ingredients where not made so I decided to finish them
- I decided to add a Search by name in home page to filter meals and by pressing button you go to the closest name of this recipe and get its details (through ID)
- Inside Area and Ingredients I added another search component in order to make it more user-friendly
- I wanted to add dark mode too and found a good combination of colors
