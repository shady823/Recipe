A dynamic recipe app built with React, where users can explore meals, view details, and discover ingredients using TheMealDB API
. This project demonstrates fetching API data, interactive UI design, and responsive frontend development.

## Features

🔍 Live search for recipes

🍽 View detailed recipe information, including ingredients and area

🌙 Toggle between Dark and Light Mode

🏠 Navigation between pages using React Router

📱 Responsive UI powered by HeroUI

## Technologies Used

React.js – Component-based frontend framework

HeroUI – Icons and UI components

React Router – Client-side routing

Fetch API – Data fetching from external API

Tailwind CSS / CSS – Styling and responsive design

## What I Learned

During this project, I improved my skills in:

- **Working with APIs**: Fetching, handling, and displaying dynamic data in React.
- **React framework**: Building component-based applications, managing state, and passing props effectively.
- **UI/UX design**: Incorporating **HeroUI** to create clean, responsive, and interactive interfaces.
- **Frontend best practices**: Organizing components, routing, and building reusable elements.
- Debugging and understanding asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

This project strengthened my understanding of combining **APIs with modern frontend frameworks** to create real-world applications.

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Problem:** Category cards didn’t show area  
  **Solution:** Learned how to use TheMealDB API correctly and implemented area fetching  
- **Problem:** Routing between pages was inconsistent  
  **Solution:** Used React Router effectively and organized routes  
- **Problem:** Integrating multiple components  
  **Solution:** Built reusable components and passed props correctly

## What I added more

- Area and Ingredients where not made so I decided to finish them
- I decided to add a Search by name in home page to filter meals and by pressing button you go to the closest name of this recipe and get its details (through ID)
- ## Future Improvements
- 
# What I can improve
- Add user authentication and favorites  
- Save favorite recipes locally or to a database  
- Inside Area and Ingredients I added another search component in order to make it more user-friendly
- I wanted to add dark mode too and found a good combination of colors
